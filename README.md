# linkerd2-ci-metrics

This project generates a report for the CI builds at the [Linkerd2
repo](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2). 

Each day a cronjob (as defined in `.github/workflows/build-report.yml`) will
trigger the creation of the report, which is uploaded as an artifact to the
workflow, under the Actions tab.

The report is a zip file containing a single file `report.html` that is
self-contained, i.e. it doesn't depend on fetching external js libraries or any
other kind of asset.

### Reports

The first pane shows the global success of all the CI runs in the repo,
aggregating over all the workflow runs whose jobs weren't cancelled. Below
that rate is segregated per workflow.

The second plane shows the success rates per job, from less to more successful.

The bottom panes show the list of error messages captured through Github
annotations from more to less frequent. These are shown just for the workflows
that run integration tests: Kind integration, Cloud integration and Release.

### API Requests

The program makes use of Google's
[go-github](https://github.com/google/go-github) library, to hit the following
Github APIs:

```
# This gives us a list of check suite IDs, for a given workflow name:
GET /repos/linkerd/linkerd2/actions/workflows/:workflow_name/runs

# For each check suite ID, this gives us the check run ID, job name,
# completion status and timestamps:
GET /repos/linkerd/linkerd2/check-suites/:check_suite_id/check-runs

# For each check run ID, we invoke the annotations API which gives us the file
# name and error message
GET repos/linkerd/linkerd2/check-runs/:check_run_id/annotations
```

Please note the report takes about an hour to generate, due to having imposed
throttling on the Github API requests to avoid hitting the rate limit.

### Authentication

The Github API requests are authenticated using the `REPORTS_TOKEN` secret, containing
a Personal Access Token belonging to l5d-bot.

### Testing

`go test ./cmd` will test that the html report is generated without errors, using
as inputs the list of jobs and annotations found under `./cmd/testdata/jobs.json`
and `cmd/testdata/annotations.json`.

You can view the sample report generated with that data with `go test ./cmd -v`

Those sample files under `./cmd/testdata` can be updated with real data by
setting the `REFRESH_DATA` environment variable prior to running, e.g.:

```
REFRESH_DATA=1 GITHUB_TOKEN=xxx go run ./cmd > report.html
```
